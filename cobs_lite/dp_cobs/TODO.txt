-fix save aliases bug
(Bug? Never crashed on my computer. Only ShowDialog() was called, so this might
be just .NET being slow and buggy. Migrating to GTK+ may help.)

-apply ilog fonts to current buffer
(Should be much easier with GTK+: see
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/TextWidget.html for more)

-save/load ilog preferences
(A JSON file would probably work best, with a format similar to that of
Settings\PreviousSession.hbs.)

-log rtf
(This may help, although you can see this project's been dormant for years:
http://pyrtf.sourceforge.net/)
