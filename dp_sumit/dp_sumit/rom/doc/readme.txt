P_goldenears_rom is a program that is run from rom, and is used for receiving a program and writing it to/executing it from iram. First the uart is intialized to a baud rate of 115200.  This causes NAKs, to be sent out as per the xmodem protocol-using the xmodem component.  A sender of the program can then send data as per the xmodem protocol in response to these NAKs.  P_goldenears_rom then receives xmodem packets, packet by packet.  Once it receives a packet p_goldenears_rom loads the data contained in the packet into Iram - (the first packet's data is placed at the start of Iram, the second packet 128 bytes in, etc.)  Once the xmodem protocol is completed, and all of the packets have been received the first instruction at the base of iram is executed.


The main source file, which contains the program flow described above is rom.c.  Rom.c contains imain which is where main code execution begins.  The p_goldenears_rom program also utilizes drivers contained in the ibase, ilog, leon, ibuild, spectareg, xmodem, and leon components, although under normal execution no ilog messages should be sent through the uart.
