This a very basic test to ensure that the XModem library works in polling mode

It does the following

1) starts up & prints out an XModem message, letting the user know it has started
2) waits 15 seconds.  This is in case Tigger doesn't support XModem, or to allow
another uart program to be tested, there will be enough time to disconnect Tigger
from the uart and connect another program
3) Does an XModem transfer.  Please send a text file for readability
4) waits 15 seconds
5) prints back whatever was received
