This test first configures the uart. It then sends as startup ilog message. It then  sets up an ISR which will be triggered by a timer 2 interrupt.  The ISR doesn't do anything, it just returns.  It then starts timer 2.  It then begins a for loop, each time sending an ilog message with an interation number, and waiting for the message to send.  After the for loop, the timer is stopped, and the for loop is repeated.  The test then sneds out a message indicating that it has finished.  A user of this test would have to make sure that the ilog messages all make it out in, in order, in spite of the timer interrupts.
