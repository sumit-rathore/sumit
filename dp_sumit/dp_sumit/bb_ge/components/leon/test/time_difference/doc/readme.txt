The test begins by configuring the uart, initializing a timer, and then requesting the user for input.  Once the test has received one complete line of user input, it reads the value on the timer and stores it.  It then waits for more bytes to come through the uart. Once it has received a byte it reads the uart again, and then calls EON_TimerCalcUsecDiff with the start and end times. It then prints out a message containing the time difference so that a user can compare the one calculated by the target to a time difference from a stop watch.
