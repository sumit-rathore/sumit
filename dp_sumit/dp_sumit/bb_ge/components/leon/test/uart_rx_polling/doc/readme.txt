This test first initializes the uart.  It then waits, polling the uart and storing each byte it receives into a buffer.  Once the program receives a '/n' or the buffer is full (1000 characters) it writes back all of the received bytes through the uart.  A user of this test needs to sne a string through the uart to the target, and then varify that the string echoed back, up to 1000 characters, is the one that was sent.
