This test first configures the uart, and registers an isr to handle uart interrupts.  This isr, stores characters read through the uart in a buffer of size 1000. Once the character '/n' is received, or the buffer is full, the isr writes back the characters stored in the buffer through the uart, and no longer stores new characters.  A user of this test needs to send, through the uart, a string to the target.  The user then needs to varify that the target echoes back the correct string, up to a length of 1000.
