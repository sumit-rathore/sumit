This test first configures the uart.  It then sends an ilog message indicating that it has started.  It then begins a for loop, each time sending an ilog message which contains the iteration of the for loop.  It does not wait for the ilog message to send, so only ilog messages up to the point where the buffer is full should be recieved.  It then sends a message saying that it is done.  The user of this test should verify that each of the ilog messages, up to the point where the buffer becomes full, are in order.
