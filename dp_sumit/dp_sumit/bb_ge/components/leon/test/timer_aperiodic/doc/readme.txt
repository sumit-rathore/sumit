The test first configures the uart and intializes the timers.  It then  registers a timer 2 isr to interrupt every 1000ms.  It then sends a startup message saying that its about to start the timer.  The timer 2 isr contains an iteration variable which it interrupts each isr call. During each isr call it outputs a n ilog message which contains the index, and waits for the message to be sent, so that each message will be sent.  The isr is never stopped and should continue to output forever. The user of this test should varify that isr keeps outputting messages and that in each the iteration is one greater than the last.
