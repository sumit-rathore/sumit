This test initially announces that it has started.  It has the number 0x12345678 stored into a source variable.  It prints this out as part of the start message.
It then copies the number to a destination location using memcpy.  It them prints out another message which contains the destination variable, so that a user can compare the value stored at the destination with that at the source to varify that they are the same.  The test is then completed.
