The test starts by announcing that it has started.  It has a string stored at a source location.  It then prints out the string from the source location, byte by byte.  It then calls memset on the source string, aiming to replace each character with 'a'.  It then prints out a message saying that the string has been set to 'a'.  It then prints out the string from the source location again, byte by byte.  A user of this test would have to verify that each character is now an 'a'.   It then announces that the test has completed.
