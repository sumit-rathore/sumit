This test is used to test the function fifo_Empty.  This test creates an integer fifo which it adds numbers to, and removes numbers from.  The test tracks how many numbers have been written to the fifo and how many have been read from the fifo, and after each read or write, it calls fifo_Empty.  The response from fifo_Empty is compared to the expected value and a string is printed out indicating the expected value, and whether or not fifo_Empty returned as expected.  The user of this test must manually verify that all of the output says that the test went successfully.  This test is compiled with make, using the makefile in the build directory, and is to be run as a c program on a linux box, (not on the target.)  The program generated will be in the bin directory.
