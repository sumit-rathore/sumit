Icron USB over Network ATSHA204 Programming Information
=======================================================

The following document describes how the Icron USB over Network device expects
the Atmel ATSHA204 chip to be pre-programmed.


GPG Encryption
--------------

An Icron secret is always sent by e-mail encrypted with GPG in passphrase
(symmetric) mode.  The passphrase is only to be sent over the phone.  In the
.txt unencrypted form, it contents are a byte array of the secret key.

Files are encrypted by running the following:
gpg --passphrase-file icron_uon_secret_key.passphrase_NO_EMAIL.txt --cipher-algo aes256 --output icron_uon_secret_key.gpg --symmetric icron_uon_secret_key.txt

Decrypting a file with a passphrase:
gpg --output icron_uon_secret_key.txt --decrypt icron_uon_secret_key.gpg

Note: GPG for Windows can be downloaded here -> http://files.gpg4win.org/gpg4win-2.1.0.exe


ATSHA204 Configuration Values
----------------------------

The following bytes must be written to the ATSHA204 configuration zone, where
writeCfgByte() takes a byte address argument, and a data byte to write 2nd
argument.  Bytes 0 to 15 are readonly and left at their defaults settings.
Bytes 52 to 87 should also be left at their default settings.

writeCfgByte(16, 0xc8)
writeCfgByte(17, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(18, 0xAA)
writeCfgByte(19, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(20, 0x8F)
writeCfgByte(21, 0x80)
writeCfgByte(22, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(23, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(24, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(25, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(26, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(27, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(28, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(29, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(30, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(31, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(32, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(33, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(34, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(35, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(36, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(37, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(38, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(39, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(40, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(41, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(42, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(43, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(44, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(45, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(46, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(47, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(48, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(49, 0x00)
writeCfgByte(50, 0x0F)
writeCfgByte(51, 0x00)


ATSHA204 Configuration Locking
------------------------------

Once the configuration has been written to, it must be locked, with the LOCK
instruction.  The lock instruction must take the CRC of the entire
configuration section.  This means the configuration bytes that were not
written, must be read, to calculate the CRC.  The CRC will vary as each chip
has a unique serial number.


ATSHA204 Data/OTP Sections
--------------------------

Data Slot 0:
The icron_uon_secret_key.txt must be written to data slot 0

Data Slot 1:
Byte 0, must contain the value 0x01
Bytes 1-6, must contain the MAC address in big endian order
Bytes 7-31, must contains the bytes 0x00

Data Slots 2-15:
Must be written with all 0x00

OTP Zone:
Can be left as the default 0xFF for all bytes


ATSHA204 DATA/OTP Locking
-------------------------

Once the data section has been written to, it must be locked with the LOCK
instruction.  The lock instruction must take the CRC of the entire data and OTP
sections, so this must be calculated first.  The CRC will vary as each chip
will be pre-programmed with a unique MAC address.
