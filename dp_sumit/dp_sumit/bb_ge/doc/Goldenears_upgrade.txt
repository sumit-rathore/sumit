# Goldenears ASIC Firmware Upgrade Procedure

## Contacting Iron
For the latest version of this document, the flash writer and firmware images, e-mail Icron
technical support (techsupport@icron.com).

## Datasheet
Pins referenced in this document are described in more detail in the datasheet
"90-01154-XXX Core 23xx Datasheet.pdf"

## Serial Port Configuration
The serial ports receive and transmit pins on the Goldenears based product are C23_UART_RXD and
C23_UART_TXD respectively.  The serial port operates at a baud rate of 115200 bits per second, with
parity N, 8 data bits and 1 stop bits.

## Upgrade Steps
1. Connect the serial port using the settings specified in the Serial Port Configuration section of
   this document.
2. Pull the C23_BOOT_SEL0 pin of the Goldenears based product low
3. Reset the Goldenears based product by pulsing the PROG_B pin low.
4. Wait until Bootloader startup string is received on the serial port.
   It should look like this
    printf("Goldenears %x.%x.%x Bootloader version %d.%d\n", ...);
    printf("%s PlatformID %d\n", GRG_IsDeviceLex() ? "Lex" : "Rex", GRG_getPlatformId());
   The Goldenears based product will now transmit a NAK character (Hex: 0x15) to initiate the
   transfer of the firmware image.
5. Transmit FlashWriterGoldenears.bin over the serial port using the XMODEM protocol.
   The XMODEM protocol is [described on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM).
6. Wait for the Goldenears based product to print the message "Serial Flash Erase Complete" to the
   serial port.  This indicates that the flash is now erased and ready for programming.  The
   Goldenears based product will now transmit a NAK character (Hex: 0x15) to initiate the transfer
   of the firmware image.
7. Transmit either the Rex image RexFirmwareGoldenears.bin, or the Lex image
   LexFirmwareGoldenears.bin over the serial port using the XMODEM protocol.
   The XMODEM protocol is [described on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM).
8. Pull the C23_BOOT_SEL0 pin high.
9. After completion of the upgrade, the system will wait for a carriage
   return/linefeed (CR/LF) prior to rebooting itself.  Alternatively, pulse
   PROG_B low to reset.
