Setting static IP addresses for USB over Network project
========================================================

By default USB over network runs in DHCP mode.

The Hobbes script flash_var.py, can be used to reprogram flash settings, but it
requires variables to be entered as 32bit numbers, instead of 4 8bit numbers.

For convience there is a script called network_settings.py that contains the
function "configureNetwork(ip, subnetMask, defaultGateway)".  This can be
called in the python window to set IP addresses in a human readable
"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" format.

Example:
configureNetwork("192.168.2.100", "255.255.255.0", "192.168.2.1")

To switch back to DHCP mode, rerun the Hobbes script flash_var.py, and change
NETWORK_ACQUISTION_MODE to 0.
