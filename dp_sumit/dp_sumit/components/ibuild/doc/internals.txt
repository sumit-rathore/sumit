This file is not intended as a design document of the internals of ibuild, but as a quick reference to anyone editing rules.mak

Variables
=========

From user:
----------
Version info:
IBUILD_PROJECT_MAK_CONFIGURED_VERSION

Project name:
PROJECT

Target file to build:
TARGET

Type of file of the target:
TARGET_TYPE

Lists of files without paths, files should be in src/:
ASMSOURCES
CSOURCES

List of components without paths:
COMPONENT_DEPS

Directory where components can be found:
TOP_LEVEL_COMPONENTS_DIR

Components that must be forced into the linker (ie -whole-archive option is passed to linker):
FORCED_LINK_DEPS

Ilog file for component that contains path:
COMPONENT_ILOG_FILE

Tools flags:
CFLAGS
LDFLAGS
LDFLAGS_TEST_HARNESS

Tools:
AWK
SED
CC
LD
AR
RM
MKDIR
RMDIR

A convience for other components makefiles to quickly include ibuild, location of rules.mak:
IBUILD_RULES

Indication to not build dependant components (ie if unset treat as not equal to 0):
BUILD_DEPS

Created by ibuild:
------------------
Lists of files without paths:
DEPENDS
OBJECTS
IFILES 
SFILES 

Lists of files with directories:
OBJS_W_DIR
DEPS_W_DIR
I_W_DIR
S_W_DIR

Components to build with phony extension (this variable defines dependencies for components to be built)
COMPONENT_DEPS_BUILD

Tool flags after ibuild manipulates them:
iLDFLAGS
iCFLAGS

ibuild's directories:
obj_dir
targ_dir

dummy files used to indicate presence of their directory:
targ_dir_stamp
obj_dir_stamp

make function to build a target:
targ_build

quiet rules, these vary in whether they are a function or a convience, consult the definition for each one:
QUIET_CC
QUIET_DEP
QUIET_LD
QUIET_AR
QUIET_MKDIR
QUIET_RM
QUIET_RMDIR
QUIET_MAKE_COMP
QUIET_ILOG
QUIET_ILOG_MAIN
QUIET

Variables that are only defined if that target is defined in TARGET_TYPE:
itarget_elf
itarget_lib_collector


RULES
=====

$(TARGET):
The default rule is $(TARGET).  This is a phony rule causes $(targ_dir)/$(TARGET) to be built, as well as accompanying ilog files

$(targ_dir)/$(TARGET):
This rule builds the target as a library or elf depending on the TARGET_TYPE specified, it will call the appriopriate function for this type

ibuild_update_ilog:
This builds the ilog files and if necessary combines them with the component ilog files

test:
Currently builds the test harnesses.  In the future should build unit tests as well.  For library targets no recursion will be done into component dependencies.

%.component:
builds a dependant component, when BUILD_DEPS is not equal to '0'

$(obj_dir)/%.o:
$(obj_dir)/%.d:
$(obj_dir)/%.i:
$(obj_dir)/%.s:
builds object/dependency/preprocessed/assembly/etc files.  There are a few versions depending on the source (ie .c .s .S .i)

obj_dir_stamp:
targ_dir_stamp:
Creates directories and an empty stamp file to indicate the directory exists

clean_component:
cleans all the files for this component, and may depend on the clean_deps

clean_tests:
cleans all the test harnesses.

clean:
clean_ibuild:
clean depends on clean_ibuild, which depends on the other clean rules

clean_deps:
cleans all the dependencies
