This test first initializes the timer and uart.  It also registers a timer 2 isr.  It then gives a startup message, and begins the timer.  The isr increments a volatile iteration variable which it also outputs with an ilog message.  The main function monitors the iteration variable, and once it reaches 10, stops the timer interrupts, and sends a test finished message.  Someone using this test should varify that the ilog messages with iteration variable up to 10 should be printed by the isr, but that after that there should be a single test finished message,and the iteration messges should no longer be printed.
