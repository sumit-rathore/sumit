This test first configures the uart. It then sends as startup ilog message. It then  sets up an ISR which will be triggered by a timer 2 interrupt.  The ISR doesn't do anything, it just returns.  It then starts timer 2.  It then begins a for loop, each time sending an ilog message with an interation number, not waiting for the message to send.  This means that only a certain number of ilog messages will be sent before the fifo becomes full.  After the for loop, the timer is stopped, and the for loop is repeated.  The test then sneds out a message indicating that it has finished.  A user of this test would have to make sure that the all ilog messages, up to a certain point, all make it out in, in order in spite of the timer interrupts.
