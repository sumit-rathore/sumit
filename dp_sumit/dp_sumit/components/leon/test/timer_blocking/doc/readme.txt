The tests starts by configuring the uart and initializing the timer.  It then sends a startup message inidicating that it will block for a period of time, which will be noted as part of the message.  Currently, 5 seconds.  It then calls TimerWaitMicroSec, pasing it that period of time. After the TimerWaitMicroSec is finished, it prints out a test finished message.  The user of this test could varify that the time between the two messages is very close to the time indicated, as the timd that TimerWaitMicroSec will wait for.
