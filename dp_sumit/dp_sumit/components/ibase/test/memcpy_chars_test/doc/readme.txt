This test first sends a message that it has started.  It then prints out, byte by byte, a string stored at a source location.  It then calls memcpy to copy the string from the source location to the destination location.  It then  prints out a message saying that it will print out the string stored at the destination location. It then prints out the string stored at the destination location, byte by byte.  It should be identical to the one from the source location, something that a user of this test will have to verify.  It then prints out a message to say the test is finished.
