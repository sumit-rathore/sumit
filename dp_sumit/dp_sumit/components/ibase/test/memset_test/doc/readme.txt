This test has the number 0x12345678 stored in a source location.  It starts by announcing that the test has started and printing out the number.  It then calls memset on the number setting each portion to 0.  It then announces that the number has been set to 0, and prints out the message.  A user would need to varify that the number is now 0 and not something else.  Then the test is done.
